### How much time did you spend on this test?

Answer:

I did the test as few hours per day and an estimated 14 ~ 15 hours were used to complete the whole test.

### Why did you choose this particular boilerplate or framework?

Answer:

The reason for choosing Vue JS was because VUE CLI is really good at setting up and my current job involves React so that's why I wanted to show that I'm capable of writing code using different frameworks. I believe both (React & Vue) have their own benefits. The boiler plate was good to start but I wanted to present something created my own from scratch.

### What's your current experience in the framework you used? (no experience, beginner, advanced, expert)

Answer:

I'll put my self on advance for both VUE & React because I have a Job-based experience of 2 years. 

### What would be the improvements on the technical part if you had to send this app to production? (A more complete version is already in production)

Answer:

Some UI Improvements such as a hint of scrolling. I small button appears when a user has scrolled too much down and hitting that button will instantly take user on top(saves time in scrolling back to top).
Sorting can be of different types.
A filter container showing different filters that can be applied to the Messages List.
A search field is needed.
A light transition when on mobile.
The app can be PWA App and can be installed as an Application from a browser inside Mobile Devices.
The Agence Dropdown button can be a bit more elegant :)
Overall UI looks good and attractive from a user perspective.

### Have you met issues that you left on the side to finish in time and how would you solve them?

Answer:

No such issues I've faced. Infinite Scrolling was a little tricky but I managed it. The documentation was really well written and helped a lot.
